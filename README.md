# gitlet
This project is based on the [project 2](http://cs61b.ug/sp15/materials/proj/proj2/proj2.html) of Berkeley CS61B course in SP2015.

Gitlet is a version control system, which mimics some of the basic features of the popular version control system [git](http://git-scm.com/), but it is smaller and simpler.

To initiate a gitlet repository in current directory, use <code>java Gitlet init</code>.
